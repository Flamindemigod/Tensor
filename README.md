## Why Tensor?
Tensor was born as a meme in my head, born from the fact that something called Matrix exists. Check them out [here](https://github.com/matrix-org), they're pretty cool.

Memes aside, Tensor was born primarily because I've run into plenty of issues with other chat clients, mainly in regards to basic wayland screen sharing support. Now does that really need a whole new chat application? No. Not really. I just wanted to make one. 
Tensor is not really meant for large scale use, and is mainly just a experiment with stuff such as WebRTC and just having a nice little hangout with my friends.

## How to get started?

Idk. You tell me.
